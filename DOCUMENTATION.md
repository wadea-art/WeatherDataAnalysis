## Project Overview

The Weather Data Analysis application is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze historical weather data and extract meaningful insights through statistical analysis and data visualization. Built with Python and Streamlit, this interactive application allows users to explore weather patterns, correlations between variables, and seasonal trends from weather datasets.

The application processes raw weather data from CSV files, performs necessary cleaning and preprocessing, and presents interactive visualizations and statistical analyses through an intuitive web interface. Users can explore various aspects of the data including temperature variations, humidity patterns, and correlations between different weather parameters.

## Key Features

### Data Loading and Cleaning

**Summary:** This feature handles the initial processing of weather data from CSV files, preparing it for analysis.

**Detailed Description:**
- Loads weather data from CSV files using Pandas
- Converts date strings to proper datetime objects with timezone handling
- Extracts date components (year, month, day, hour) for time-based analysis
- Renames columns for cleaner access and better readability
- Handles missing values using appropriate strategies
- Detects and manages outliers using statistical methods (IQR)
- Creates derived features when needed for analysis

This foundational component ensures data quality and consistency throughout the application. The cleaning process is designed to handle common issues in weather datasets such as inconsistent date formats, outliers due to measurement errors, and missing values.

### Basic Statistics

**Summary:** Provides fundamental statistical measures for key weather variables.

**Detailed Description:**
- Calculates central tendency measures (mean, median)
- Computes dispersion statistics (standard deviation, range)
- Shows minimum and maximum values for each variable
- Displays results in an organized tabular format

This feature gives users an immediate overview of the data distribution and characteristics. The statistics provide a quantitative summary of each weather variable, establishing context for the more detailed analyses that follow.

### Univariate Analysis

**Summary:** Enables in-depth exploration of individual weather variables through visualizations and detailed statistics.

**Detailed Description:**
- Interactive variable selection from available weather parameters
- Histogram with kernel density estimation (KDE) showing value distribution
- Box plot displaying the median, quartiles, and potential outliers
- Expanded statistics including percentiles, skewness, and kurtosis
- Split-panel layout for comparing different visualization types

This feature helps users understand the distribution characteristics of each variable, identify potential outliers, and assess whether the data follows normal distribution patterns. The combination of visualizations and statistics provides a comprehensive view of each weather parameter.

### Time Series Analysis

**Summary:** Analyzes how weather variables change over time at different temporal aggregation levels.

**Detailed Description:**
- User-selectable time aggregation (day, week, month, year)
- Interactive time series plots showing trends and patterns
- Daily pattern analysis displaying how variables change throughout a typical day
- Appropriate date formatting and axis labeling based on the selected time scale
- Trend line options for identifying long-term patterns

This feature is crucial for understanding seasonal variations, long-term climate trends, and daily cycles in weather patterns. The flexible time aggregation allows users to zoom in on short-term fluctuations or zoom out to see broader patterns over longer periods.

### Bivariate Analysis

**Summary:** Explores relationships between pairs of weather variables through visualizations and correlation analysis.

**Detailed Description:**
- Interactive selection of X and Y variables for comparison
- Scatter plots with regression lines to visualize relationships
- Calculation and display of correlation coefficients
- Comprehensive correlation heatmap for all variable pairs
- Detailed correlation table with sorted relationships

This feature helps identify dependencies and associations between different weather parameters, such as how temperature relates to humidity or how wind speed affects apparent temperature. Understanding these relationships is essential for weather forecasting and climate modeling.

### Key Weather Questions

**Summary:** Addresses specific meteorological questions with targeted analyses and explanations.

**Detailed Description:**
- Seasonal temperature pattern analysis with monthly averages
- Investigation of temperature-humidity relationship
- Analysis of wind speed's effect on apparent temperature (wind chill)
- Weather conditions associated with different precipitation types
- Daily temperature cycle examination

Each question is explored through appropriate visualizations and accompanied by explanatory text that interprets the findings in meteorological context. This feature demonstrates practical applications of the data analysis and helps users understand complex weather interactions.

### Summary Report

**Summary:** Provides a comprehensive overview of findings and insights from the weather data analysis.

**Detailed Description:**
- Overview of dataset scope and time range
- Summary of key temperature patterns and ranges
- Overview of prevalent weather conditions
- Summary of important correlations between variables
- Downloadable PDF report for sharing and reference
- Clear organization with sections and subsections

This feature consolidates the most important insights into a cohesive narrative, making the findings accessible and easy to understand. The PDF download functionality allows users to save and share the analysis results for reference or presentation purposes.

## Technical Implementation

The Weather Data Analysis application is built using several Python libraries and technologies:

- **Streamlit**: Provides the interactive web interface with widgets, layouts, and data display components
- **Pandas**: Handles data loading, manipulation, cleaning, and statistical analysis
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Create data visualizations including plots, charts, and heatmaps
- **NumPy**: Performs numerical computations and array operations
- **SciPy**: Provides additional statistical functions and analysis tools
- **ReportLab**: Generates formatted PDF reports

The application follows a modular structure with separate components handling different aspects of the data analysis pipeline:

1. **Data Processing**: Handles reading CSV files, converting date formats, and preprocessing data
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates various statistical measures and correlations
3. **Visualization**: Creates different types of plots and charts for data exploration
4. **Reporting**: Generates formatted reports summarizing the findings

The implementation emphasizes interactivity, allowing users to select variables, time periods, and analysis methods according to their specific interests and needs.
